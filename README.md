# BIBIRAGE
BIBIRAGE is a simple beverage ordering system I coded to practice using Java Swing. The UI is semi-inspired by Omori (partly bc i was too lazy to design it with colors haha).

- would prolly fix the UI in the future xd (or not)
- source code in "BIBIRAGE/BIBIRAGE/src" directory
- run the MainApp with the other classes on the same project file
