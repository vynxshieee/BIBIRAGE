# BIBIRAGE
BIBIRAGE is a simple beverage ordering system I coded to practice using Java Swing. The UI is semi-inspired by Omori (partly bc i was too lazy to design it with colors haha).

- would prolly fix the UI in the future xd (or not)
- don't mind the pay now btn and sugar lvl/qty display :p
  
- source code in "BIBIRAGE/BIBIRAGE/src" directory
- run the MainApp together with the other attached files
- u might need to change the directory for the icons/images in the code to the downloaded file path for it to appear.
